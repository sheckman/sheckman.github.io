## Biography
I am an Alumni Distinguished Undergraduate Professor with the Department of Computer Science. I serve as the Director of Undergraduate Programs for the department. I am a three time graduate of the department, and received my Ph.D. in August of 2009 as part of the RealSearch Group. I received the [NC State University Outstanding Teacher Award](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/news/1740) and the [Alumni Association Outstanding Teacher Award](http://www.alumni.ncsu.edu/s/1209/interior-hybrid-2col-min.aspx?sid=1209&gid=1&pgid=779) as a representative of the College of Engineering in Spring 2015. I am a member of the Academy of Outstanding Teachers at NC State. As a graduate student, I was a three-time recipient of the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship.

My research interests are in the science of software as applied to computing education research ([SOS-CER](https://sos-cer.github.io/)) - specifically software engineering skill transfer and automated feedback.
