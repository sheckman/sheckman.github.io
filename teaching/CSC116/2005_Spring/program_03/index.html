<H1>Program 3: Java to HTML Converter</H1> 
<H2>Submit date:  Sunday, 3 April 2005 at 11:55 p.m.</H2>

<hr>
<H2>Software Overview</H2>
<P>One of the problems with presenting Java programs online as source
code is that HTML does not allow certain characters to be easily displayed.
HTML also ignores multiple spaces for indention.  You could use the 
&lt;PRE&gt; tag to keep the code formatting, but that results in lines 
which do not wrap and can cause odd looking HTML.</P>
<P>Your job is to design a program which will allow a user to translate
a valid Java source code file to a HTML file.  This means that the user
will provide you with the name of a Java source code file in your GUI,
and you will translate it to HTML and provide the user feedback.</P>
<P>The translation must add four lines to make a valid HTML file.  You
must add the lines:<BR>
&lt;HTML&gt;<BR>
&lt;BODY&gt;<BR>
to the top of the HTML prior to the translated material.  You must
then follow the translated material with the lines:<BR>
&lt;/BODY&gt;<BR>
&lt;/HTML&gt;<BR>
</P>
<P>The IO will be performed in the JavaHtmlModel class.  That
class will be responsible for reading the input and passing
each line to the translator.  The JavaHtmlModel class will be
responsible for adding the two lines to the top and bottom of
the file.</P>
<P>Between these tags you will translate the Java to HTML.  The 
translation is a line by line translation.  There are three stages
to the translation.  The translation of the line will occur
in the JavaHtmlLine code.  This code will need to perform no 
file IO, but will receive the data from the JavaHtmlModel to 
translate.</P>
<P>The first stage of the translation is to replace all of the spaces
and tabs at the beginning of the line with the &amp;nbsp; non-breaking space 
character text.  That means
if the file contains four spaces you would replace then with the
text &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .  Make sure you replace
each space with the &nbsp; text and remove the space in the process.  The
text should have no leading or trailing space added to it.</P>
<P>The first stage will end as soon as you find a non-space or non-tab
character.</P>
<P>The second stage will be to replace characters which are not valid 
with their equivalent.  For each replacement you should replace the 
character which is a problem with the exact text without adding any
extra spaces.</P>
<P>The characters to translate are:
<UL>
	<LI>The &amp; character must be translated to the &amp;amp; text
	<LI>The &lt; character must be translated to the &amp;lt; text
	<LI>The &gt; character must be translated to the &amp;gt; text
</UL>
You must replace each occurrence of the offending character with the 
valid HTML text substitution.</P>
<P>The third stage is the add the &lt;BR&gt; tag to the end of the line.
You should add this tag right after the last character of the input line
and it should be the last thing on the line with no trailing spaces.</P>	
<P>The JavaHTML program will read all of the input from a text
file and output the results to a text file.  The GUI will display
the status of the operation.  The outputs which the GUI can display
include:
<UL>
	<LI>Unable to open input file!
	<LI>Unable to open output file!
</UL>
If either of these two conditions occur you should close any
open files and not perform any translation.  The application
can also encounter errors during or after the translation.
These include:
<UL>
	<LI>Error during translation!
	<LI>Error closing files!
</UL>
All, some or none of these errors may occur.  If any of these
errors occur then they should be displayed and no other status
should be displayed.  All of these errors will be caused by
an IOException, which is the only exception type you need to 
check for in the application.
</P>
<P>If the input is read, translated to html, and output 
with no errors then the message "Translated xx lines from yy to
HTML in zz"  The count of input lines should be
include all lines in the input file.  The value xx is the count
of lines in the input file.  The yy value is the name of the Java
source file.  The zz value is the name of the HTML output file.  
For example from the included Hello.java you would receive the 
message: "Translated 14 lines from Hello.java to HTML in Hello.html".
</P>
<P>The GUI should be identical to the GUI in the sample application.
The application must include several major elements.
The items include a label for the
input file name, the JTextArea for input file name,
a label for the status, the JTextArea for status, and a JButton.
The user will input the input file name
in the text box and press the "Go" button to update
the status.  The status area will show either an error message
or output the statistics.</P>
<P>The model will include setInputFilename method which will be
used by the GUI to update the file name.  It will also include
a getStatus method which will generate a String and return
it to be displayed in the GUI.</P>
<P>Make sure you view the sample input and output files described below.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Requirements </H2>
<P>Your program must create the class JavaHtmlLine and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public JavaHtmlLine()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must set the initial value of
	the line to an empty, zero length String.</DD>
	<DT>public void setLine(String)</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will accept a single String as a parameter
	and set the value of the line to that String.  This
	method should NOT change the value of the input line if it
	is provided a null value.</DD>
	<DT>public String getLine()</DT>
	<DD>This will return the value of the instance variable
	in the original form without translation.</DD>
	<DT>public String getHtmlLine()</DT>
	<DD>Gets the line translated into HTML.  This follows
	the rules given in the overview portion of the assignment
	to convert a single line to HTML.  This should <B>NOT</B>
	corrupt the original input value, because the user may
	call getLine to see the original input.</DD>
	<DT>public static void main(String[] args)</DT>
	<DD>Main method which should contain your test code to
	show you have tested your model.  This will prove your
	code has been tested and is a <B>REQUIRED</B> method.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Your program must create the class JavaHtmlModel and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public JavaHtmlModel()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must set the initial value of
	the input file name and output file name to an empty, zero
	length String and the status to "None".</DD>
	<DT>public void setInputFilename(String)</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will accept a single String as a parameter
	and set the value of the input file to that String.  This
	method should NOT change the value of the input file
	if it is provided a null value. The file name provided
	should include the entire name including the extension of 
	the file.</DD>
	<DT>public String getOutputFilename()</DT>
	<DD>Method which will translate the input file name to
	an output file name which is the same name with the
	extension changed to .html instead of .java as per
	the specifications.</DD>
	<DT>public String getStatus()</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will return either an error String
	or the status of the translation a single String.</DD>
	<DT>public void translate()</DT>
	<DD>This method will perform the actual translation from
	the input to the output file.  The actual opening, processing
	and closing of the files will occur here.  This is also 
	where the individual lines will be fed to a JavaHtmlLine
	object.</DD>
	<DT>public static void main(String[] args)</DT>
	<DD>Main method which should contain your test code to
	show you have tested your model.  This will prove your
	code has been tested and is a <B>REQUIRED</B> method.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Your program must create the class JavaHtmlGui and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public JavaHtmlGui()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must create the GUI and set
	it up.</DD>
	<DT>public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent)</DT>
	<DD>This method is required to handle the actions 
	generated from the button.</DD>
	<DT>public void main(String[])</DT>
	<DD>This method must be exactly as given below:<BR>
<CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main (String args[]) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaHtmlGui myGui = new JavaHtmlGui();<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myGui.show();<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR>
</CODE>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>You may not have <B>ANY OTHER PUBLIC ITEMS</B> in your code.
All other items must be private.  Your code must run with the 
given main method and must meet the specifications below.</P>
<HR>
<H2>GUI Specification</H2>
<P>The input JTextAreas should be a single line tall and allow
the user to input a value.  It will be preceded by a single
JLabel describing the input areas.</P>
<P>The output JTextArea should be 10 lines tall and be inside
a JScrollPane.  The JTextArea should have scrolling enabled
and should not allow the user to edit the area.  The code below
is a demonstration of how to setup the JTextArea:<BR>
<CODE><BR>
JTextArea output = new JTextArea(10,40); //Create the text area<BR>
output.setEditable(false); //Do not allow the user to edit<BR>
output.setLineWrap(true); //Allow the lines to wrap<BR>
output.setWrapStyleWord(true); //Wrap at the white spaces<BR>
JScrollPane outputScroll = new JScrollPane(output); //Let the text area scroll<BR>
</CODE>
<BR>
These items require javax.swing.* and java.awt.* be imported.</P>
<P>The GUI must implement the actionPerformed method.  The only
item which should trigger this method to run is the user pressing
the "Go" button.  The pressing of the "Go" button should be used
to run the translation in the model and then to update the
status display.</P>
<P>Remember that in order for the GUI to use the model object
you must create a local variable of type JavaHtmlModel
inside the GUI.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Sample Items and Pregrading</H2>
<P>There is NO formal pregrading available for this program.  Instead
we offer you two other options for you to evaluate your own code.  You
can download to jar files:
<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="JavaHtml.jar">Java to HTML sample program</A>
	<LI><A HREF="JavaHtmlGrader.jar">Java to HTML conformance grader</A>
</UL>
To run the sample program you should download the jar and type
"java -jar JavaHtml.jar".  This will allow you to run the full
program.  Do not attempt to use the code from this program in
your own work in any way.</P>
<P>The grader program will verify that all three of your class
files meet the program specifications.  To use this you should
place the jar in the same directory with your compiled, working
program and run "java -jar JavaHtmlGrader.jar all".  This will
test all three of your classes to ensure the public items in the
class meet our requirements.  <B>THIS IS ONLY TESTING THE
METHODS MEET THE PROGRAM SPEC!!! YOU MUST TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY
YOURSELF.</B></P>
<P>We have also included a sample input <A HREF="Hello.java">Hello.java</A>
and a sample output <A HREF="Hello.html">Hello.html</A> which you
may view to compare to your output.</P>
<P><A HREF="javadoc">Click here</A> to view a sample of the JavaDoc
from the answer key.  You should reference this in the design of 
your program to make sure you are using the correct method signatures.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Extra Credit</H2>
<P>Extra credit will be offered for assignments that are submitted
early.  You will receive one points of extra credit for each full 
day early that you submit your program.  A maximum of 10 points of
extra credit may be obtained.  We will examine the dates of the files
in your submit locker to determine the amount of extra credit.  The
file with the latest submission date will be the date we use to determine
the extra credit.</P>
<P>In order for you to receive extra credit you <B>MUST</B> submit
a working program that meets the project specifications.  Programs
which do not compile or deviate from the specifications will not
receive extra credit.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Documentation Specifications</H2>
<P>Each method, instance variable and class you write in 
JavaHtmlLine.java, JavaHtmlModel.java and JavaHtmlGui.java must be documented
using the JavaDoc style of documentation.  Remember 
all JavaDoc starts with /** and ends with */. The course style
guidelines contain information on using JavaDoc.</P> 
<P>Remember that when generating JavaDoc you must first document
the description of the item (method, instance variable, or class) and then
put your tags (@author, @param, and/or @version).  Good places to
find JavaDoc examples include:
<UL>
	<LI>Class style guidelines (linked from syllabus)
	<LI>All course sample code in the lectures (linked off each lecture)
	<LI>Course textbook
</UL>
