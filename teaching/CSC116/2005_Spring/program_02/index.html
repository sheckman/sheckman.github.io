<H1>Program 2: Check Writer</H1> 
<H2>Submit date:  Sunday, 10 October 2004 at 11:55 p.m.</H2>

<hr>
<H2>Software Overview</H2>
<P>In this assignment you will be designing a program to output
a dollar amount in the range of 0.00 to 999999.99 as English text
as it would appear on a check.</P>
<P>The program must match the output of the included applet exactly,
so please take note of the applet output and test your code against 
it.</P>
<P>You will be only designing the model code.  The GUI code is 
provided.  <A HREF="CheckWriterGUI.java">Please click here</A> to
download the GUI once you have COMPLETED your model code.  The
GUI will not compile or run unless your model methods match
the method signatures outlined below exactly.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Requirements </H2>
<P>Your program must create the class CheckWriterModel and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public CheckWriterModel()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must set the initial value of
	the check amount to 0.00</DD>
	<DT>public double getCheckAmount()</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will return the value of check amount
	as a double when called.</DD>
	<DT>public void setCheckAmount(double)</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will accept a single double as a parameter
	and set the value of the check amount to that double.  This
	method should NOT change the value of the check amount
	if it is provided a negative value.  You should truncate
	any fractional pennies.</DD>
	<DT>public String getCheckWords()</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will return the value of check amount
	as English text as outlined below.</DD>
	<DT>public static void main(String[] args)</DT>
	<DD>Main method which should contain your test code to
	show you have tested your model.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<P>You may not have <B>ANY OTHER PUBLIC ITEMS</B> in your code.
All other items must be private.  Your code must run with the 
given GUI and must meet the specifications below.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Specification</H2>
<P>Your program must accept a double value in the range of
0.00 to 999999.99 and translate it to English text.</P>
<P>The setCheckAmount method will be how we provide your
object with a value.  This method must handle two special
cases:
<UL>
	<LI>Negative values
	<LI>Values with fractional pennies
</UL>
If a negative value is provided the method should not 
change the instance variable.  If a value with a fractional
penny amount, such as 5.955, is provided then you should 
truncate the fractional penny.  In this example that means
a setCheckAmount(5.955) would result in getCheckAmount()
returning 5.95.</P>
<P>The getCheckAmount method must return the value of the
check amount that was set with the setCheckAmount method.</P>
<P>The constructor will initially set the check amount to
0.00.  Your constructor is where all of your private instance
variables must be initialized.</P>
<P>The getCheckWords method is the method which will translate
the double value in to text. It must return a String containing
proper English text.  For the value 123456.78 the program would
return the String:
<CODE><BR>One Hundred Twenty Three Thousand Four Hundred Fifty Six Dollars and 78 Cents<BR></CODE>
</P>
<P>Your program must handle the following special situations:
<UL>
	<LI>The word "Dollars" must be plural except when dealing
	with a single dollar.  In that case it must be "Dollar".
	<LI>The word "Cents" must be plural except when dealing with
	a single cent.  In that case it must be "Cent".
	<LI>All cent outputs must be 2 digits
</UL>
This means 1.01 would read "One Dollar and 01 Cent".  The values
between 1.00 and 1.99 will read with "One Dollar".  
</P>
<P>Your program must also take in to account having values less
than one dollar.  In this case you must print "Zero Dollars" and
then the cents portion of the output.  This means 0.75 would
print as "Zero Dollars and 75 Cents".
</P>
<P>The first letter of each word except for the "and" must be in
a capital letter.  Your output must match the provided applet 
<B>EXACTLY</B> so please test against the applet.</P>
<P>The provided GUI will only function once your model code meets
the method signatures.  If you attempt to compile the GUI and it
does not compile that means your model code is not setup according
to specifications.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Documentation Specifications</H2>
<P>Each method, instance variable and class you write in 
CheckWriterModel.java must be documented using the JavaDoc style of
documentation.  Remember 
all JavaDoc starts with /** and ends with */. The course style
guidelines contain information on using JavaDoc.</P> 
<P>Remember that when generating JavaDoc you must first document
the description of the item (method, instance variable, or class) and then
put your tags (@author, @param, and/or @version).  Good places to
find JavaDoc examples include:
<UL>
	<LI>Class style guidelines (linked from syllabus)
	<LI>All course sample code in the lectures (linked off each lecture)
	<LI>Course textbook
</UL>
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Sample Materials</H2>
<P><A HREF="javadoc">Click here</A> to view a sample of the JavaDoc
from the answer key.  You should reference this in the design of 
your program to make sure you are using the correct method signatures.
</P>
<P>You have been provided a sample applet to use in this assignment.
Your output must match the applet output exactly.  You can view
the applet directly in any Java 2 enabled web browser, or use the 
applet viewer at the command line by typing the following on a single line:<BR>
<CODE>
<BR>
appletviewer&nbsp;http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/program_02/applet.html

<H2>Working on your program during lab</H2>

<P>Part of three sessions of lab have been set-aside for you to work on 
your program.  You are REQUIRED to work during the entire allocated
lab time on your program, unless it is complete.</P>

<P>While working in lab on your program, the <B>ONLY</B> person who
you should consult for assistance is the lab instructor.  Working
with other students on this program is strictly forbidden.</P>
<P>You are expected to work on your code during lab.  You may not
leave lab until a TA has cleared that your code is working and
submitted and the lab for that session is working and submitted.</P>

<HR>
<H2>Submitting Your Code</H2>

<p>Before you submit your work, make sure the program:<BR>
<ol>
<li type="1">meets the <a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/common/style_guidelines.pdf">style guidelines posted online</a> for the course  </b> 
<li type="1">behaves as specified in this document. You should test your
code thoroughly. Be sure to know what results should displayed for
each major scenario.
<li type="1">Is thoroughly tested
<li type="1">satisfies the <a href="gradesheet.html">
gradesheet</a> for this assignment.
</ol>
</P>
<P>You should submit your program through Wolfware Submit:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</blockquote>
<BR>
<P>The name of the assignment is <tt>Program2</tt>. Submit
your source code file, CheckWriterModel.java
 only. Do not attempt to submit <tt><b>.class</b></tt> files.
<P><B>The electronic submission deadline is precise 
and does not allow for late work. Do not be late.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Count on the system going down and on other students looking
for workstations the last day the assignment is due. Count on serious
server delays because everyone is trying to access the submit software
during the last few minutes the program is due.</P>

<P>You are able to make multiple submissions of the same file 
(the later submissions overwrite the earlier ones with the same file name). 
To be on the safe side, start submitting your work as soon as you have 
completed a substantial portion.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Hard Copies (On Campus Sections Only)</H2>
<P>When you turn in your program electronically, 
print off the <a href="gradesheet.html">grade sheet</a>
and fill out the following information:<BR>
<ul>
<li>your name
<li>your lab instructor's name
<li>your lab section number
</ul>
</P>

<P>Staple the <a href="gradesheet.html">grade sheet</a> to the
top of your program source file listing and bring the entire packet to
class on the lecture following the electronic submission deadline. I
collect the packets at the <B>beginning</B> of class time.
