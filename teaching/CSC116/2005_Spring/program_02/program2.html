<h1 align= center>Program 2: Math is Fun </h1>
<hr>
<H3>Submit date: Sunday, March 13  2005 at 11:55 p.m. </H3>
<hr>
Contrary to what  Barbie dolls said a few years ago, math is
not hard, it is fun! 
<p>
For program 2, you will write a program that implements a game to teach
arithmetic to your younger brother/sister.  The program will test
addition and subtraction.
<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
Requirements explain <i>what</i> a program must do.
<p>
Your game will provide 4 levels of play.
<p>
Level 1: Tests addition of two, positive, single-digit numbers. <br>
Level 2: Tests addition of two, positive, two-digit numbers. <br>
Level 3: Tests subtraction of two, positive, single-digit numbers. <br>
Level 4: Tests subtraction of two, positive, two-digit numbers.
<p>
Consider zero to be a positive number
<p>
Generate random problems and get the player's input. The player gets
2 tries per problem. Advance from one level to the next when the player
has achieved a score of five points on the previous level. One point is
awarded for each correct answer.
<p>
After a player has reached level 4, just repeat problems on that level
until the player quits playing or starts a new game.
<p>
Provide a mechanism for the player to start a new game and a way to
quit.
<p>
The player interface must be graphical.
<p>
The picture below shows how the interface might look. You can structure
your interface differently if you wish as long as you follow the
specifications below.

<h2>Design Specification</h2>
Design specifications provide details on <i>how</i> you must implement
the program.
<p>
Your program must consist of two classes:
<li> a GamePlayGUI class
<li> a GamePlayModel class

<p>
The GamePlayGUI class provides the "view" of your program and the
GamePlayModel class provides the "model".  
<hr>
<h3>GamePlayGUI Class Specification</h3>
Your GUI class will have 3 methods:
<li> public GamePlayGUI (GamePlayModel model) // constructor
<li> public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent event) // responds to button clicks
<li> public static void main(String [ ] args) 

<p>
The <code>main()</code> method must be 
<pre><b>
public static void main (String [] args) {

&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePlayModel model = new GamePlayModel();
&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePlayGUI   gui   = new GamePlayGUI( model );
}
</b></pre>

Since this is the first GUI that you will write, we decided to provide some
assistance by giving you the source code for a program that converts
degrees fahrenheit to degrees celsius.
<p>
The GUI looks like this:
<p>
<center>
<img src= "f2c.gif" width = 300 height = 120>
</img>
</center>
And here is the code that produced it:
<li><a href = "FahrtoCelsiusGUI.java">FahrtoCelsiusGUI.java</a>
and the model code
<li><a href = "FahrtoCelsiusModel.java">FahrtoCelsiusModel.java</a>



<hr>
<h3>GamePlayModel Class Specification</h3>

Your GamePlayModel class must contain appropriate instance variables and 
methods useful for this application. You must include a <code>main()</code> method in this class that
provides "unit testing" for the class. In particular, your <code>main() </code>method should
call all of the methods in the class and print the results to the screen.
<h3>Required Methods</h3>
The GamePlayModel class must have the following public methods. 
<b>
<li> public GamePlayModel() // the constructor
<li> public String getProblem() //returns the problem for the player to solve
<li> public void   processAnswer( String guess) //determines correctness of answer
<li> public String getMessage() //returns feedback to the player on correctness
                                  
<li> public int    getScore( ) //returns the current score for display 
<li> public void   startNewGame() //starts a new game
<li> public static void main (String [ ] args) //provides unit testing of class methods
</b>

<p>
Here is an example of how to test your class in the main method.  You must
add atleast <b>two</b> more test cases similar to this one.

<pre><b>
public static void main(String [] args) {

     GamePlayModel model = new GamePlayModel();
     System.out.println(model.getProblem());
     model.processAnswer("3");
     System.out.println(model.getMessage());
     System.out.println("Current Score: " + model.getScore());
     model.startNewGame();
     System.out.println("Current Score: " + model.getScore());
     
     //add extra test cases here
}

</pre></b>


<hr>
<h4>Random Numbers</h4>
You will need a random number generator to create new problems for the player.
<p>
Random numbers are not truly random. They are generated based on some seed
value (e.g. a value created from  time of day). Java provides several 
tools for generating these pseudo-random values. For this assignment, you
must use the <b>Random</b> class. 
<p>Provide this import statement at the top of the source file:
<p>
<pre><b>
import java.util.*;
</b></pre>
<p>
Create a <b>Random</b> object in your constructor.
Make the Random object reference an instance variable.
<p>
Use the <b>nextInt()</b> method to generate
the random numbers for your sample problems.
<p>
<b>nextInt(n) </b>returns a random integer value between 0 and (n-1).
For example,
<pre><b>
private Random r; //<i> instance variable</i>


r = new Random(); //<i>goes in constructor</i>


int operand1;
operand1 = r.nextInt(10); //<i>use in getProblem() method</i>
</b></pre>
results in  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9 being stored in <code>operand1</code>.
  <hr>
<h4> Strings to ints</h4>
Values typed into text fields are returned as a String value. This value
will be passed from your GUI to your model. The <code><b>processAnswer
(String guess)
</b></code> method will have to determine if the guess is the correct
answer. 
<p>
In order to do this, the <code>String</code> must be converted to an
<code>int</code> value. Here is how to do the conversion:

<pre><b>
int  value;

value = Integer.parseInt( guess );
</b></pre>
Unfortunately, an exception will be thrown if the value can not be converted
to an integer. For example, the player typed <code>go pack!</code> for the
 problem
answer. <b>For this assignment, you may assume the player typed a valid integer
value.</b>
<hr>
<h3>Sample Applet</h3>
One of the CSC116 TAs, Alex Balik, wrote his version of the program as
a java applet that runs inside the browser. You can check it out
<a href = "display.html">here</a>.
<p>
Notice that only one of the text fields in the applet can be edited.  You are not 
required to do this, but the following command will make a textfield uneditable.
<pre><b>
JTextField myTextField = new JTextField("This textfield can't be edited");

myTextField.setEditable(false);
</b></pre>

<hr>
<H2>Extra Credit</H2>
<P>Extra credit will be offered for assignments that are submitted
early.  You will receive 1 point of extra credit for each full 
day early that you submit your program.  A maximum of 10 points of
extra credit may be obtained.  We will examine the dates of the files
in your submit locker to determine the amount of extra credit.  The
file with the latest submission date will be the date we use to determine
the extra credit.</P>
<P>In order for you to receive extra credit you <B>MUST</B> submit
a working program that meets the project specifications and
receive a grade of 80% or greater prior to the extra credit.  Programs
which do not compile or deviate from the specifications will not
receive extra credit.</P>

server delays because everyone is trying to access the submit software
during the last few minutes the program is due.</P>

<P>You are able to make multiple submissions of the same file
(the later submissions overwrite the earlier ones with the same file name).
To be on the safe side, start submitting your work as soon as you have

print out the <a href="gradesheet2.html">grade sheet</a>
and fill out the following information:<BR>
<ul>
<li>your name
<li>your lab instructor's name
<li>your lab section number
</ul>
</P>
<HR>
<H3>Hard Copies (On Campus Sections Only)</H3>
