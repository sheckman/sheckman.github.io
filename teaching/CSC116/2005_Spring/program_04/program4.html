<h1 align = center> Program 4: Video Poker </h1>
<hr>
<h2>Submit deadline: Sunday, April 24 at 11:55 p.m.</h2>
<hr> 
In program 4, you will implement a popular casino game called video poker. The
card deck contains 52 cards, 13 of each suit. At the beginning of the game, the
deck is shuffled. Then the top five cards of the deck are presented to the player. <p>
The player can reject none, some, or all of the cards. The rejected cards are
replaced from the top of the deck. 
<p>
Now the hand is scored. 
<p>
Your program will announce which (only 1) of the following matches the hand:
<li>Royal Flush -- The best possible hand in poker. A 10, jack, queen, king, and ace, all of the same suit.
<li>Straight Flush -- A straight and a flush: Five cards with consecutive values of the same suit.
<li>Four of a Kind -- Four cards of the same value, such as four queens.
<li>Full House -- Three of a kind and a pair, for example, three queens and two 5's.
<li>Flush -- Five cards, not necessarily in order, of the same suit.
<li>Straight -- Five cards with consecutive values, not necessarily of the same suit, such as 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The ace can either precede a 2 or follow a
king.
<li> Two pairs -- Two pairs, for example, two queens and two 5's.
<li> One pair -- One pair, for example, two 5's.
<li> No pair -- The lowest hand, containing five separate cards that do not match to create any of the hands above.

<hr>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<i>Specifications</i> provide details on <strong>how</strong> your work must be done.
<h3>The Shuffled Deck </h3>
A shuffled deck will be provided as a file. The file will be named 
<strong>deck.txt</strong>.  The file will contain 52 lines, one for each card. 
<p>
Each line of the file will contain two fields, a number from 1 (for ace) to
13, and a character representing the suit: <strong>H</strong> for hearts,
 <strong>S</strong> for spades,
<strong>C</strong> for clubs, and <strong>D</strong> for diamonds. 
<p>
The face cards will be represented as numbers: 11 for jack, 12, for queen,
and 13 for king.
<p>
A sample deck is provided in <a href = "./deck.txt">deck.txt</a>. Here are some sample decks with the first five cards in the deck corresponding to a specific type of hand. You will have to rename the deck to deck.txt to use. 
<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/royalFlush.txt">royalFlush.txt </a></p>
<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/straightFlush.txt">straightFlush.txt </a></p>

<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/fullHouse.txt">fullHouse.txt </a></p>
<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/flush.txt">flush.txt </a></p>
<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/straight.txt">straight.txt </a></p>
<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/twoPair.txt">twoPair.txt </a></p>
<p><a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc116/lec/001/PROGRAMS/PROGRAM4/STACKEDDECKS/noPair.txt">noPair.txt </a></p>
<p>
If your program cannot successfully open <strong>deck.txt</strong>, display a message to
the console and exit. If your program should encounter problems while
reading the deck , also
put a message on the console and exit. We will not deliberately put
errors in the <strong>deck.txt</strong> file. 

<hr>
<h3>The GUI </h3>
The GUI must be in a class called <strong>PokerGUI</strong>. You will
complete a GUI to provide the following functionality: 
<li> The user is presented with 5 cards. Cards numbered 
11, 12, and 13  in the deck.txt must be displayed
as Jack, Queen and King respectively. The Card numbered 1 must be displayed
as Ace.
<li> The user can select none, some, or all to be replaced and then view
the resulting hand.  After a user selects a button to replace cards, you
must disable the appropriate buttons. For example, if a user wants to
replace all cards, then all replace buttons should become disabled. More
specifics are given below. 
<li> The score (i.e. type of match) is displayed to the user when a 
ScoreHand button is clicked.  The message that is displayed must match
the ones described in the model specification.

<li> A Quit button  ends the program. [The game is over after one hand but
the user must shut down the program using the Quit button].
<p>
Below is one example of the GUI:<p>
<img src = "./pokergui.gif" >
<p>
The code that produced this gui is at <a href = "./PokerGUI.java">
PokerGUI.java</a>. It must be completed by you. You must add
<li> javadoc 
<li> appropriate button disabling
<li> connection to your model
<p> 
This GUI was created by Alex Balik, TA for section 005.  Alex used a 
<code>BorderLayout</code>. He placed the cards  in 
<code>BorderLayout.WEST</code>, the replace buttons in <code>BorderLayout.CENTER</code> and the rightmost buttons in the <code>BorderLayout.EAST</code>.
The top is a textfield in <code>BorderLayout.NORTH</code> and the
score button is in <code>BorderLayout.SOUTH</code>.
<p>
He used <code>JPanel</code>s for the cards and  buttons, setting them to
<code>GridLayout</code> to get the even spacing of the components.
<p>
He set the larger font size for components using the <code>setFont</code> method.
For example, the ScoreHand button was set to 18 point font:
<pre>
btnScore.setFont(new Font("Times",Font.BOLD,18));
</pre>
He got that interesting color of red using:
<pre>
btnCard1.setBackground(Color.red.darker());
</pre>
You can check out colors on the <a href = "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/">
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/ </a>. Just select the <strong>Color</strong>
class.
<p>
It was mentioned earlier that you must disable buttons. 
To disable a button named <code>btnReplaceAll</code>, use the <code>setEnabled</code>
 method:
<pre>
btnReplaceAll.setEnabled(false);
</pre>
Here is the specification for disabling buttons:
<table         BORDER="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" id=infoblock >
<tr> 
<th colupan="2" valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffcc">Button clicked</th>
<th colspan="2" valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffcc">Disable these buttons</th>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>Replace </td>
<td>The Replace button that was clicked, the ReplaceAll and the ReplaceNone
buttons </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Replace All </td>
<td>All Replace buttons, Replace All and Replace None </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Replace None </td>
<td>All Replace buttons, Replace All and Replace None </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>The Model </h3>
The model must be in a class called <strong>PokerModel</strong>. The model
<b>must</b> manage the card deck <i>and</i> the hand of cards using arrays of <strong>Card
</strong>objects. The card deck will contain 52 card objects and the
user's hand wil contain 5 card objects.
<p>
The <a href = "Card.java">Card.java</a> is provided for you. The <strong>Card
</strong> class has been designed so that you can use another java class
to sort an array of <strong>Card</strong>s. The <strong>Card</strong> class
has a main which demonstrates how to sort a Card array. The line of
code is
<pre>
Arrays.sort (array, 0, 3);
</pre>
You must provide 
<pre>
import java.util.*;
</pre>
to use the sort.
<br>
The parameters are the name of the array to be sorted, the index of
the first element, and the total number of elements to be sorted (not
the last index).  The Cards will be sorted first based on the value on
the Card. If two (or more) Cards have the same value, they will be ordered
by suit. That ordering is alphabetical: "C","D","H", then "S". 
<p>An  ace has the value of 1 so it gets sorted as a low value card but
can be used as a high card (e.g. Royal Flush). Your code must deal with
this if you choose to use the sort routine. 
The sort statement belongs in your model.
<p>


<p>
The model must have the following public methods:
<strong>
<li>public PokerModel() 
</strong>
<br>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your instance variables.
This includes the deck of cards and the initial hand.
<strong>
<li>public Card getCard (int whichOne)
</strong>
<br>
Method which accepts a integer value  0,1,2,3, or 4 and returns
the corresponding Card in the hand of cards. 
<strong>
<li>public Card replaceCard (int whichOne)
</strong><br>
Method which receives an integer value 0, 1,2, 3, or 4 and 
replaces that card in the hand of cards.  The replacement card will be
the next card in the deck. The method  returns the replacement Card.
<strong>
<li>public String scoreHand()
</strong>
<br>
Method  that returns a String indicating one of tthe following
matches for the current hand:
<pre>
Royal Flush
Straight Flush
Four of a Kind
Full House
Flush
Straight
Two Pairs
One Pair
No Pair
</pre>
<p>
<strong>
<li>public String toString () 
</strong>
Method that returns a String with the current hand of cards, one card
per line.
<br>
<strong>
<li>public static void main (String [ ] args) 
</strong>
<br>
Method used for testing the public methods in this class.
<p>

You may not have <strong>Any Other Public Items </strong> in your code.
All other items must be private. 
<hr>

<h2>Running the Program</h2>
We will use the   main() in your <strong>PokerGUI</strong> class. It must
remain  
like this:
<pre>
public static void main (String [] args) {

PokerGUI gui = new PokerGUI();
}
</pre>
Create the model inside the <strong>PokerGUI</strong> class like you
did for program 3.
<hr>

<P>Extra credit will be offered for assignments that are submitted
early.  You will receive one points of extra credit for each full
day early that you submit your program.  A maximum of 10 points of
extra credit may be obtained.  We will examine the dates of the files
in your submit locker to determine the amount of extra credit.  The
file with the latest submission date will be the date we use to determine
the extra credit.</P>
<P>In order for you to receive extra credit you <B>MUST</B> submit
