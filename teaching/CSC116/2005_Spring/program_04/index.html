<H1>Program 4: Pig Latin</H1> 
<H2>Submit date:  Sunday, 21 November 2004 at 11:55 p.m.</H2>

<hr>
<H2>Software Overview</H2>
<P>The software you are writing is a Pig Latin translator.  Pig
Latin in this assignment will adhere to a set of simple rules:
<OL>
<LI>All words that can be translated must be at least one letter long 
and can only contain letters.  All valid words will contain at 
least one vowel.
<LI>Words that start with a vowel (A,E,I,O,U) simply have "WAY" appended to the end
<LI>Words that have only Y as a vowel (by, my, try) simply have AY appended to the end
<LI>Words that start with a consonant have all consonant letters up to the first vowel moved to the end of the word and AY appended.  You never be given a word with no vowels.
</OL>
</P>

<P>The software will remove the question marks, periods, and exclamation
points from the input.  All output will be strictly in lowercase.  Words
will be considered any group of characters which end in either:
<UL>
<LI>A space
<LI>The end of a line
<LI>A period
<LI>An exclamation point
<LI>A question mark
</UL>
Your program must break each sentence into words and count
each item as a word.  Some of the words can be translated 
into Pig Latin while others can not.  Words which can be 
translated must contain only upper and lower case letters.
Words which contain numbers and non-punctuation characters
should not be translated.
</P>

<P>The Pig Latin program will read all of the input from a text
file and output the results to a text file.  The GUI will display
the status of the operation.  The outputs which the GUI can display
include:
<UL>
	<LI>Unable to open input file!
	<LI>Unable to open output file!
</UL>
If either of these two conditions occur you should close any
open files and not perform any translation.  The application
can also encounter errors during or after the translation.
These include:
<UL>
	<LI>Error during translation!
	<LI>Error closing files!
</UL>
All, some or none of these errors may occur.  If any of these
errors occur then they should be displayed and no other status
should be displayed.  All of these errors will be caused by
an IOException, which is the only exception type you need to 
check for in the application.
</P>
<P>If the input is read, translated to pig latin, and output 
with no errors then the message "Translated ?? out of a total
of ?? words to pig latin."  The count of input words should be
include all words in the file.  The count of translated words
should include only words with all letters that could be changed
to Pig Latin.</P>
<P>The GUI should be identical to the GUI in the sample application.
The application must include several major elements.
The items include a label for the
input file name, the JTextArea for input file name,
output file name, the JTextArea for output file name,
a label for the status, the JTextArea for status, and a JButton.
The user will input the input and output file names 
in the text boxes and press the "Go" button to update
the status.  The status area will show either an error message
or the output the statistics.</P>
<P>The model will include setInputFilename and 
setOutputFilename methods which will be
used by the GUI to update the file names.  It will also include
a getStatus method which will generate a String and return
it to be displayed in the GUI.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Requirements </H2>
<P>Your program must create the class PigLatinWords and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public PigLatinWords()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must set the initial value of
	totalCount and the pig words to zero.</DD>
	<DT>public void setWord(String)</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will accept a single String as a parameter
	and set the value of the input word to that String.  This
	method should NOT change the value of the input word if it
	is provided a null value.  If the word is non-null then
	the total word count should be incremented.  Once the word
	is set then it should be translated to pig latin.  If the
	word can be translated the translated counter should be
	incremented.</DD>
	<DT>public String getWord()</DT>
	<DD>This will return the value of the instance variable
	in the original form.</DD>
	<DT>public String getPigWord()</DT>
	<DD>This retrieves the Pig Latin version of the word.  If
	the word could not be translated this should retrieve
	the original word.</DD>
	<DT>public int getTotalCount()</DT>
	<DD>This retrieves the current count of words which have
	been set.</DD>
	<DT>public int getPigCount()</DT>
	<DD>This retrieves the current count of words which have
	been translated.</DD>
	<DT>public int getNonPigCount()</DT>
	<DD>This retrieves the difference between the total count
	and the translated count.  This is the number of words
	not translated.</DD>
	<DT>public static void main(String[] args)</DT>
	<DD>Main method which should contain your test code to
	show you have tested your model.  This will prove your
	code has been tested and is a REQUIRED method.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Your program must create the class PigLatinModel and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public PigLatinModel()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must set the initial value of
	the input file name to input.txt, the output file name
	to output.txt, and the status to "None".</DD>
	<DT>public void setInputFilename(String)</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will accept a single String as a parameter
	and set the value of the input file to that String.  This
	method should NOT change the value of the input file
	if it is provided a null value.</DD>
	<DT>public void setOutputFilename(String)</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will accept a single String as a parameter
	and set the value of the output file to that String.  This
	method should NOT change the value of the output file
	if it is provided a null value.</DD>
	<DT>public String getStatus()</DT>
	<DD>Method, which will return either an error String
	or the status of the translation a single String.</DD>
	<DT>public void translate()</DT>
	<DD>This method will perform the actual translation from
	the input to the output file.  The actual opening, processing
	and closing of the files will occur here.  This is also 
	where the individual lines will be broken into words.</DD>
	<DT>public static void main(String[] args)</DT>
	<DD>Main method which should contain your test code to
	show you have tested your model.  This will prove your
	code has been tested and is a REQUIRED method.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Your program must create the class PigLatinGUI and implement
the following public methods:
<DL>
	<DT>public PigLatinGUI()</DT>
	<DD>Null constructor, which must initialize all of your
	instance variables.  This must create the GUI and set
	it up.</DD>
	<DT>public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent)</DT>
	<DD>This method is required to handle the actions 
	generated from the button.</DD>
	<DT>public void main(String[])</DT>
	<DD>This method must be exactly as given below:<BR>
<CODE><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main (String args[]) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PigLatinGUI myGUI = new PigLatinGUI();<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myGUI.show();<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR>
</CODE>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>You may not have <B>ANY OTHER PUBLIC ITEMS</B> in your code.
All other items must be private.  Your code must run with the 
given main method and must meet the specifications below.</P>
<HR>
<H2>GUI Specification</H2>
<P>The input JTextAreas should be a single line tall and allow
the user to input a value.  It will be preceded by a single
JLabel describing the input areas.</P>
<P>The output JTextArea should be 10 lines tall and be inside
a JScrollPane.  The JTextArea should have scrolling enabled
and should not allow the user to edit the area.  The code below
is a demonstration of how to setup the JTextArea:<BR>
<CODE><BR>
JTextArea output = new JTextArea(10,40); //Create the text area<BR>
output.setEditable(false); //Do not allow the user to edit<BR>
output.setLineWrap(true); //Allow the lines to wrap<BR>
output.setWrapStyleWord(true); //Wrap at the white spaces<BR>
JScrollPane outputScroll = new JScrollPane(output); //Let the text area scroll<BR>
</CODE>
<BR>
These items require javax.swing.* and java.awt.* be imported.</P>
<P>The GUI must implement the actionPerformed method.  The only
item which should trigger this method to run is the user pressing
the "Go" button.  The pressing of the "Go" button should be used
to run the translation in the model and then to update the
status display.</P>
<P>Remember that in order for the GUI to use the model object
you must create a local variable of type PigLatinModel
inside the GUI.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Sample Items and Pregrading</H2>
<P>There is NO formal pregrading available for this program.  Instead
we offer you two other options for you to evaluate your own code.  You
can download to jar files:
<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="PigLatin.jar">Pig Latin sample program</A>
	<LI><A HREF="PigLatinGrader.jar">Pig Latin Grader</A>
</UL>
To run the sample program you should download the jar and type
"java -jar PigLatin.jar".  This will allow you to run the full
program.  Do not attempt to use the code from this program in
your own work in any way.</P>
<P>The grader program will verify that all three of your class
files meet the program specifications.  To use this you should
place the jar in the same directory with your compiled, working
program and run "java -jar PigLatinGrader.jar all".  This will
test all three of your classes to ensure the public items in the
class meet our requirements.  <B>THIS IS ONLY TESTING THE
METHODS MEET THE PROGRAM SPEC!!! YOU MUST TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY
YOURSELF.</B></P>
<P>We have also included a sample input <A HREF="test.txt">test.txt</A>
and a sample output <A HREF="result.txt">result.txt</A> which you
may view to compare to your output.</P>
<P><A HREF="javadoc">Click here</A> to view a sample of the JavaDoc
from the answer key.  You should reference this in the design of 
your program to make sure you are using the correct method signatures.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Extra Credit</H2>
<P>Extra credit will be offered for assignments that are submitted
early.  You will receive 2 points of extra credit for each full 
day early that you submit your program.  A maximum of 20 points of
extra credit may be obtained.  We will examine the dates of the files
in your submit locker to determine the amount of extra credit.  The
file with the latest submission date will be the date we use to determine
the extra credit.</P>
<P>In order for you to receive extra credit you <B>MUST</B> submit
a working program that meets the project specifications.  Programs
which do not compile or deviate from the specifications will not
receive extra credit.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Documentation Specifications</H2>
<P>Each method, instance variable and class you write in 
PigLatinWords.java, PigLatinModel.java and PigLatinGUI.java must be documented
using the JavaDoc style of documentation.  Remember 
all JavaDoc starts with /** and ends with */. The course style
guidelines contain information on using JavaDoc.</P> 
<P>Remember that when generating JavaDoc you must first document
the description of the item (method, instance variable, or class) and then
put your tags (@author, @param, and/or @version).  Good places to
find JavaDoc examples include:
<UL>
	<LI>Class style guidelines (linked from syllabus)
	<LI>All course sample code in the lectures (linked off each lecture)
	<LI>Course textbook
</UL>
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Working on your program during lab</H2>

<P>Part of two sessions of lab have been set-aside for you to work on 
your program.  You are REQUIRED to work during the entire allocated
lab time on your program, unless it is complete.</P>

<P>While working in lab on your program, the <B>ONLY</B> person who
you should consult for assistance is the lab instructor.  Working
with other students on this program is strictly forbidden.</P>
<P>You are expected to work on your code during lab.  You may not
leave lab until a TA has cleared that your code is working and
submitted and the lab for that session is working and submitted.</P>

<HR>
