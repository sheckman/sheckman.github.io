## Course Materials

### Automated Grading Tools
A [team of faculty at NC State have created several tools](https://sos-cer.github.io/projects/auto-grading) to support automated grading using professional development tools and frameworks and to support using professional tools in a classroom setting.

### CSC 216 Course Resources
I have collaborated with peers to create a set of supplemental course resources for CSC 116, CSC 216, and CSC 326 students.  Most of the resources are currently behind NC State authentication, but may be shared by request.

* [Git Guide](https://sos-cer.github.io/projects/auto-grading) - in collaboration with Jason King and Jessica Schmidt
* [Testing the Java Collections Framework](https://www.engage-csedu.org/find-resources/testing-java-collections-framework) - assignment for linear data structures.

### Peer Teaching Fellows Programming
The [Peer Teaching Fellows](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~kmp/peerteachingfellows/) program is a collaboration between Duke University, NC State, UNC Chapel Hill, and the University of Florida to develop scalable effective teaching resources for intro CS courses that utilize undergraduate students as Peer Teaching Fellows (PTFs).  

### CPATHII: Communication across the Curriculum Assignments
I developed several assignments that incorporate communication learning outcomes.

* Sarah Heckman, “Black Box Test Plan - Bug Hunt,” Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum, accessed May 29, 2014, http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/16.
* Sarah Heckman, Ed Gehringer, “Design Proposal and Rationale,” Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum, accessed May 29, 2014, http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/38.
